## Description

This repository originated from the starter code provided by Udacity.

This is a modernized version of a card-based memory match game. Scoring is based on the number of cards flipped. Try to uncover all cards in as few moves as possible!

## How to play

This is a memory-based game!

To get started, click(or tap!) a square to reveal its symbol, then click any other square to check for a match. If the cards have the same symbol, then they will remain face up(as well as changing color to indicate that they match).

If the cards do no match, then remember their location! Keep clicking cards to uncover them. Try to match all pairs of cards to win.

In order to achieve a higher rating, try to uncover the cards in as few moves as possible. To compete with friends, try to get 3 stars as quickly as possible!
